find-letter
==========

Porting Vim's `f` and `t` command to Atom.

## Installing
Use the Atom package manager, which can be found in the Settings view or run `apm install find-letter` from the command line.

## Usage
Move cursor to next occurrence of specific letter. Commands work with selection

### Commands

* `ctrl-f` - Go to next occurrence of specific letter

## TODO

* Implement BOTH `f` and `t` commands
* Search backwards
* Work with string of characters rather than single character?
